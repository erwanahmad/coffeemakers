# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, 
  but can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, 
  waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the branches. 
  Because it grows in a continuous cycle, itâ€™s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
